## NLP-101

I am very curious about **NLP**! I will be going through different projects suggested in a couple Udemy courses regarding NLP:
1. https://www.udemy.com/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python/learn/v4/
2. TBD

For the structure of this repository, I am going through the videos in the udemy courses, as well as coding along for the projects involved.
The instructor [lazyprogrammer](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/) has the projects already created in separate repositories.
So, I will be copying over his files into my repository, denoted by `lp_*`, and creating my own version as a sibling file.

Data will be stored in the `data/` directory local to my computer, and will be included in the .gitignore.
If you would like to know more about the data I am testing with, please reach out to me.
